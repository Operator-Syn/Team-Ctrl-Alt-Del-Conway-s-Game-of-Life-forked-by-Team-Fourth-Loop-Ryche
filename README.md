This repository is dedicated to exploring **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** using **various Programming Languages**, starting with **Python**.

> ⚙️ Built as a continuation and respectful fork of the original project —  
> maintaining compatibility to easily sync upstream updates while enabling a modular, test-driven refactor.

### 🔁 Development Approach  
The project follows the **Red → Green → Refactor** cycle:  
1. 🟥 **Red** — Write a failing test that defines the expected behavior.  
2. 🟩 **Green** — Implement just enough code to make the test pass.  
3. 🧹 **Refactor** — Improve the code while keeping all tests green.  

Commits may captures a step in this cycle, showing the Iterative and Disciplined Nature of Test-First Programming.

### 🎯 Objective  
Our goal is to develop a **deeper understanding of TDD principles** and strengthen **development discipline** through consistent, incremental, and test-driven design.


### 🚀 Getting Started (Onboarding)

Follow these steps to set up your local environment:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Operator-Syn/Team-Ctrl-Alt-Del-Conway-s-Game-of-Life-forked-by-Team-Fourth-Loop-Ryche.git
   cd Team-Ctrl-Alt-Del-Conway-s-Game-of-Life-forked-by-Team-Fourth-Loop-Ryche
   ```
2. **Install pipenv if not installed**
    ```bash
    pip install pipenv
    ```
3. **Activate the virtual environment**
    ```bash
    pipenv shell
    ```
4. **Install dependencies if missing or not yet installed**
    ```bash
    pipenv install
    ```
5. **Once the environment is ready, you can begin writing tests and running them via:**
    ```
    pytest -v
    ```
This setup ensures each contributor works in an isolated, consistent environment aligned with the project’s TDD workflow.
